# AGENTS.md (repo root)

## Scope
This file applies to the entire repository unless overridden by a more specific `AGENTS.md`.

## Working conventions
- Keep `README_DEMO.md` and `RUN_NOTES.md` updated when changing demo setup or run steps.
- Avoid adding MCP/A2A integration code in baseline setup work unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer small, targeted changes and document any new required environment variables.
